 ## JavaScript Game Library

***This repo contains my solution to the following exercise:***

### Part 1

1. Create a `Game()` class with the following properties:
  - `title` - title of the game
  - `genre` - the game's genre

1. Create a `render()` method on the `Game()` prototype for adding instances of the `Game()` class to the DOM.

1. Create a `GameLibrary()` class with the following properties:
  -  `title` - title of the game library - i.e., 'Video Games', 'Board Games', etc.
  -  `games` - array of all `Game()` instances

1. Create a `render()` method on the `GameLibrary()` prototype for adding instances of the `GameLibrary()` class to the DOM.

1. Add a form to the HTML document for adding new games to the game library, making sure to re-populate all the games on the HTML document.

### Part 2

1. Add the functionality (a method) to delete the game.

### Part 3

1. Add form to the HTML document for adding new game libraries.
